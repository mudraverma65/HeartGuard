# HeartGuard: ML for Heart Disease Identification and Diagnosis Support

## Introduction
Heart disease is a significant cause of mortality, necessitating effective diagnostic tools. This project integrates machine learning research with a public health dataset to identify influential factors and exams for heart disease diagnosis. The anonymized dataset from Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V (1988) is explored to investigate the potential of machine learning models in assisting doctors in patient analysis. This was developed as an Assignment for course CSCI6515 - ML for Big Data.
